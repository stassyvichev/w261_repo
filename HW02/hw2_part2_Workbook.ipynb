Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `7a` and `7b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... _can you see why this is gong to be a challenge?_ [`HINT:` _There is a problem with trying to tally in the mapper but also a problem with waiting to do it in the reducer. _]. __For part `b` of this question you will receive full credit for any design that results in the correct conditional probabilities _without hard coding the class totals_ (i.e. you _can_ store records in memory if you so choose).__ However, for fun, we challenge you to try and figure out the stateless solution. It involves a technique that you will learn formally next week but we think you may be able to figure it out for yourself. [`HINT:` _Think about Hadoop's default sorting behavior, what determines the order in which records arrive at the reducer?  If we compute partial totals in our mappers can you think of a way to make sure that those numbers arrive at our reducer before any of the other 'regular' key-value pairs?_`]\n",

    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",

    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 7 that adding Laplace +1 smoothing makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are three approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) we could hard code it into our reducer (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it inside the reducer which would require storing some information in memory (_what information?_). Or 3) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. BONUS: which of these options is incompatible with using multiple reducers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ In future weeks we'll learn better ways to handle this kind of situation. For now, chose one of the 3 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you in Question 9 (and the calculations in the textbook example). [`HINT:` _don't start from scratch with this one -- you can just copy over your reducer code from part `b` and make the needed modifications_]."

Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23). If you can let it slide for now, MRJob (the next framework we'll learn) will have an easier way to handle this._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",

We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",

How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"

    "\n",
    "Congratulations you've completed all the required questions! If you have energy for more, let's take a moment to preview one of the important design issues that we'll tackle next week: total order sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the jobs in this assignment we've mostly used a single reducer and mostly used the default Hadoop sorting (alphabetical by key). However when we took the time to specify an alternate key to sort on and tried using multiple reducers (as we did in Questions 5d, 6e and 10d)... we saw that sorting and partitioning the data on different fields can cause our final output to no longer be sorted from top to bottom. Instead it will usually be sorted just within each partition. This is called a partial sort and in the examples we saw that was mostly what we wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've also always partitioned on a categorical field. But what if we wanted to sort on values (eg. counts in a word count file) but have too much data to fit on a single reducer and there isn't a logical categorical variable to use as a partition key? How could we ensure the the top-n words end up in `part-00000`, the next n end up in `part-00001`, etc? The solution is similar in idea to what we did in Question 10b (where we created extra fields to partition on)... but a bit more complicated because the way that Hadoop orders its partitions and writes them to file depends on an internal hash function (eg. we might expect the partition with key `ham` to end up in `part-00000` and `spam` to end up in `part-00001` but Hadoop won't necessarily order the words the way a human reader would).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Challenge Exercise:__ Write a Hadoop job that will use 5 reducers and will sort your `NBmodel.txt` file (you can use the smoothed or unsmoothed one) in descending order according to the words' conditional probability in `spam`. A few tips:\n",
    "* start by reading the [Total Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/blob/master/Resources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb) that is provided in the course repo under the HelpfulResources folder.\n",
    "* you will need to write a mapper for this job, you can do this easily on the fly using the jupyter magic command `%%writefile`.\n",
    "* when you run your job, you should see that the records in `part-00000` have higher conditional probabilities in Spam, than the records in `part-00001` which in turn are higher than in `part-00002` etc."
