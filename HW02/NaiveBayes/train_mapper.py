Mapper reads in text documents and emits word counts by class.
INPUT:
    <specify record format here>
OUTPUT:
    <specify record format here>
    
Instructions:
    You know what this script should do, go for it!
    (As a favor to the graders, please comment your code clearly!)
    
    A few reminders:
    1) To make sure your results match ours please be sure
       to use the same tokenizing that we have provided in
       all the other jobs:
         words = re.findall(r'[a-z]+', text-to-tokenize.lower())
         
    2) Don't forget to handle the various "totals" that you need
       for your conditional probabilities and class priors.
